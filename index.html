            <p>Virat Kohli (Hindi pronunciation) is an Indian international cricketer
                 who plays Test and One Day International (ODI) cricket for the Indian 
                 national team. A former captain in all formats, Kohli retired from 
                 Twenty20 International (T20I) following India's win at the 2024 T20 World Cup. 
                 He is a right-handed batsman and an occasional unorthodox right arm quick bowler.
                  He represents Royal Challengers Bengaluru in the Indian Premier League (IPL) 
                  and Delhi in domestic cricket. He holds the record as the highest run-scorer in IPL,
                 ranks third in T20I, third in ODI, and stands as the fourth-highest in international cricket.[4] 
                 He also holds the record for scoring the most centuries in ODI cricket and stands second in the list of most international centuries scored. Kohli is widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen of all time and the greatest batsman in the modern era.[citation needed] Kohli was a key member of the Indian team that won the 2011 Cricket World Cup, 2013 Champions Trophy and 2024 T20 World Cup and captained India to win the ICC Test mace three consecutive times in 2017, 2018, and 2019.</p>

                Abraham Benjamin de Villiers (born 17 February 1984) is a South African former international cricketer, and a current commentator. AB de Villiers was named as the ICC ODI Player of the Year[2] three times during his 15-year international career and was one of the five Wisden cricketers of the decade at the end of 2019.[3] He is regarded as one of the greatest cricketers in the history of the sport and the best batsman of his era, dominating the Number 1 ranking for batsmen in tests & ODIs more than any other batsman of his era.[4] [5][6] De Villiers began his international career as a wicket-keeper-batsman, but he has played most often solely as a batsman. He batted at various positions in the batting order, but predominantly in the middle-order.
